A few years ago, I got the chance to sketch out a really rough wireframe to help the company I currently work for redesign their website. I scoured the [“Awwwards”](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/) for inspiration. (If you’ve never looked through this compilation of award-winning, creative and visually stunning websites, you’re missing out on a serious opportunity to geek out over design and functionality.) I came up with what I affectionately named a “Frankenstein Wireframe” to give to the web development company who was tasked with creating a website from my design. Once I saw their final product--the undead wireframe lives!--I thought, “I want to know how to build that!” 

So the short answer is, curiosity. 

I started playing around with simple HTML and CSS. I did some free tutorials, took an in-person class where I dipped my toe into Javascript (the water was a bit cold, and I’m hoping after learning Ruby it warms up a bit), and I generally started to believe this idea that I could learn to be a web designer and developer.

It’s not really about the money, or about the newly acquired recognition for actually being able to understand what this computer is doing (and now becoming the informal office IT helpdesk). It’s really that I missed using my brain and being creative for a living, and I want the freedom of setting my schedule. And having a workspace where I can bring my cats. (They are most efficient hand-warmers while I’m typing.)

Now I’m here doing Flatiron’s Full Stack Online Web Development course, nursing a headache from working with nested hashes, and I really enjoy getting to be immersed in a problem and searching for the solution. I’m learning things I never believed I could and never imagined were even a thing to learn. I’m becoming the woman I want to be and learning to use my voice to help make the world a bit better to exist on.
